# Project Info

Taskify App: This project is a comprehensive application built using React and TypeScript. It aims to provide a practical example of how these technologies can be used together to create robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

# Features
TypeScript Integration: Ensures type safety and better code quality.
React Functional Components: Utilizes hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext.
State Management: Uses Context API for global state management.
API Integration: Fetches data from an external API and displays it in the application.
Routing: Implements client-side routing using React Router.
Form Handling: Manages forms and validations effectively.
Custom Hooks: Demonstrates the creation and usage of custom hooks.
Styling: Uses CSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles.

# Tech Stack
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Components: Functional components using hooks.
- Context API: For state management.
- React Router: For handling routing.

# TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Type Safety: Ensures type safety across the application.
- Interfaces and Types: Used for defining the shape of objects and props.
- CSS Modules: For styling components with scoped CSS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### creating react-typescript app `npx create-react-app typescript-todolist --template typescript `

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
